# Baby Steps

Developing a operating system from scratch is a complex task, so we start by doing few baby steps:

## 1) [Baby Step 1](Baby_Step_1.md):
In this step we will set up our environment and write our bootloader in assembly which for now prints 'Hello World'.

## 2) [Baby Step 2](Baby_Step_2.md):
In this step we try to read a content from the disk, learn of stack, funciton calls, etc.
